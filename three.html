      <h1> three.js </h1>
      <h3> Coding three.js was fun and interesting to learn, I had lots of ups and downs and had to change the out come quickly to make it more achievable, I created this calming scene to relax the user and give them something visually pleasing whilst having that calming breeze in the background. During the read through the code may not be in order of origin, this is so i can explain the code easier and so pieces are together that are needed. To veiw the Tree of Life working fully please visit my github and follow the instructions provided.</h3>

                  <p> This shows how all the code started, this part of the code shows how it all starts, by adding in all the code that needs to be called on as well as every variable I want to programme. There are also Pre set variables these help set the hue of the ground and the sky and helps blend them to make that never ending feel to the background of the scene. </p>

                  <h5>The Tree of Life</h5>
                  <p> 3D designing the tree was challening and fun, a lot of youtube was needed as MAYA the software I used was new to me but very rewarding with the finished product and I am proud of the outcome, I then got the tree to load in using the object loader as well as the material loader, three.js means that when you bring in an outside object to the pre programmed objects you need to include these loaders, you also need to still add the mesh as this is what will allow the object to fully appear on the scene. The leaves on the tree were the hardest part as they were already included in the material but I had to include the double side function as they were transparent to the light because of the angle they where set at. </p>

                <div class="card-body">
                  <h5>Audio</h5>
                  <p> I added audio to the scene to add to the calming effect I hoped the whole code would help people feel, I ran into a few issues adding this, in the beginning code I had to add a mute button which does not fully work but it allowed the audio to work in chrome as it was a huge issue, this is also an improvement I would like to add in the future and given more time I will be able to play more and fix this issue. The set loop allows for the sound to go on for the entire time the user is veiw the scene and the volume can also be controlled through your computer but is set at a 0.5 setting as a pre set if you can not control it. The renderer functions allows everything to enter the scene and load up efficiently. </p>

                  <h5>Instructions</h5>
                  <p> The biggest feature this scene has is the lights being able to change, I felt this would add to the calming effect as you could add the tone of light you wished to have, this needed buttons by using H which stands for the hemispere light and D for the directional light, this was capable by a key down function which called on the prepared functions already made for the lights. There was also a short paragraph added so the user knew what to do and how everything worked.</p>

                  <h5>Hemisphere Light and Directional Light</h5>
                  <p> The lights changing was a big acheivement in this code, I still wanted all lights to be white i just wanted them to activate diffrent sections and allow different shadows to be cast.</p>

                  <h5>Panning</h5>
                  <p> The panning allows the user to look around the scene, I set the minamum and maxamum settings so the user couldnt go too far from the tree but still beable to not see it at all if you just want to look at the scene background, therewas a dampining effect also added to reduce the effects that may stop the occilation. The stats added to the bottom of the code help set the frames per second meter so you can keep an eye on loading time of the scene. </p>
